Class Implementation

We can use classes for different types of:
In Battle:
  Attack
  Defend
  Use (Items, Run)
Characters: (these will "have" Attack/Defend/Item Objects, and access member functions accordingly)
  Player
  Enemies
  NPCs (optional)
Items
  Health
  Attack
  Special (Hints, Map, Sidequests)
Sorting
  Alphabetical Sort (for items)
  Sort by an Attribute (such as type/strength of items, speed of player/enemies)
Data structures
  Graphs (used for critical story events, possibly map progression, skill upgrades)
  AVL Trees (possibly used for storing hundreds of items)


Member Functions and Data Member Implementations
  Example of Attack Object Usage: Characters can "have-a" sword object, and access it's member functions accordingly. The enemy can be a parameter to the sword member function, and the function manipulates variables as needed.
