Class Implementation

Warrior, Archer, and Mage are Character objects
Character constructor has a type of character, Warrior, Archer, Mage. Depending on the constructor parameter, we give a different default HP, Attack, Defense, etc

Matthew does:
Items and Inventory, that will have sorting algorithms within them


Notes:
Edit Project Board to have Epics in Product Backlog, User Stories in the Details, and individual tasks and details there too
User Stories need reasons, look at the Epics that have reason-less user stories, and add reasons.
You can optionally have individual tasks for user stories in the project board, but those are not required.

Know the implementation details, the inheritance, the association, the return types and parameters for all Classes and functions
