Notes:
Defend, Attack, Items as separate classes? Different types of attacks?
Classes could be
  Fight
    Attack (inherits fight)
      Sword
    Defend
  
Characters can "have-a" sword object, and access it's member functions accordingly. The enemy can be a parameter to the sword member function, and the function manipulates variables as needed.


Sorting algorithms, such as items
Idea: Have Class sort, children are different sorting orders, alphabetical or reverse, type, strength, etc. Items will have class attributes, and they can be sorted accordingly.
Idea: Player and enemies share a "Character" class, since they'll share certain attributes

AVL Trees for storing items. If we have a lot of items (>100), then we can have a searching algorithm.
