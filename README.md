## Project Description
> * Why we are doing this project
>   - Our team will implement and deepen our understanding of c++ concepts such as object oriented programming, data structures and algorithms. This project will also give us a chance to collaborate with our team and reinforce our knowledge of object oriented programming, therefore simulating a real industry-like environment where collaboration and teamwork is key in order to be successful. 
>   - By working on this project as a team, we will improve our ability to communicate, solve problems as a team, and manage code through version control.
>   - This project is complex enough for us to utilize object oriented programming,
> * Languages, Tools, and Technologies Planned
>   - C++: The primary programming language we will be using is C++. We will utilize Object-oriented principles such as classes for characters, items, and environments. Data structures and sorting algorithms can be used for various in-game effects.
>   - Github/Git: version control will be managed through Github. This allows us to collaborate with each other and keep track of the development process.
>   - Visual Studio Code: We will use VS Code as our Integrated Development Environment. 
>   - Terminal: The user will be interacting with the program through the Terminal.
> * User Input and Screen Output
>   - Input: 
>     - Specific variables will be predetermined, such as types of weapons, types of movement, and the specifics of enemies attacking you.
>     - The following would take in user input
>       - Username, as a string.
>       - Environment variables. For example, a series of pre-made environments could be selected from. Or other random elements of the game could be determined by a user-inputted seed.
>       - Actions the character takes, such as using an item, launching an attack, or for pre-determined movement. This would be a regularly appearing menu, with char variables used to determine the actions taken. 
>       - A menu of the game where settings are changed, such as difficulty, using an item, or knowing some in-game progress. 
>   - Output:
>     - Variations of preset output lines will be printed to the screen. For example, "[Username] attacks [Enemy name] for [Dmg] damage!"
>     - We can also incorporate unique types of output as well, such as primitive text-based artwork showcasing the environment the player is in. 
> * Project and Gameplay Features
>   - Difficulty selection
>     - By changing the stats for player and enemy characters, the quantity and quality of items, and attributes of the environment, the player will have an easier or more difficult experience.
>   - Simple combat system: the player engages in battles by choosing actions such as “attack,” “defend,” or “use item”. The outcome will be dependent on the player's stats, enemy stats, and random number generation.
>   - Players can level up their characters (improve stats such as health, attack power, and defense). This helps them with progressing through the game as it gets more challenging.

> ## Phase III
> You will need to schedule a check-in for the second scrum meeting with the same reader you had your first scrum meeting with (using Calendly). Your entire team must be present. This meeting will occur on week 8 during lab time.
> BEFORE the meeting you should do the following:
> * Update your class diagram from Phase II to include any feedback you received from your TA/grader.
> * Considering the SOLID design principles, reflect back on your class diagram and think about how you can use the SOLID principles to improve your design. You should then update the README.md file by adding the following:
>   * A new class diagram incorporating your changes after considering the SOLID principles.
>   * For each update in your class diagram, you must explain in 3-4 sentences:
>     * What SOLID principle(s) did you apply?
>     * How did you apply it? i.e. describe the change.
>     * How did this change help you write better code?
> * Perform a new sprint plan like you did in Phase II.
> * Make sure that your README file (and Project board) are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project and the most recent class diagram. Previous versions of the README file should still be visible through your commit history.
>  * Each team member should also submit the Individual Contributions Form on Canvas for phase III. In this form, you need to fill in the names of all team members, the percentage of work contributed by each member for phase III, and a description of their contributions. Remember that each team member should submit the form individually.
> During the meeting with your reader you will discuss:
> * How effective your last sprint was (each member should talk about what they did)
> * Any tasks that did not get completed last sprint, and how you took them into consideration for this sprint
> * Any bugs you've identified and created issues for during the sprint. Do you plan on fixing them in the next sprint or are they lower priority?
> * What tasks you are planning for this next sprint.


> ## Final deliverable
> All group members will give a demo to the reader during lab time. ou should schedule your demo on Calendly with the same reader who took your second scrum meeting. The reader will check the demo and the project GitHub repository and ask a few questions to all the team members.
> Before the demo, you should do the following:
> * Complete the sections below (i.e. Screenshots, Installation/Usage, Testing)
> * Plan one more sprint (that you will not necessarily complete before the end of the quarter). Your In-progress and In-testing columns should be empty (you are not doing more work currently) but your TODO column should have a full sprint plan in it as you have done before. This should include any known bugs (there should be some) or new features you would like to add. These should appear as issues/cards on your Project board.
> * Make sure your README file and Project board are up-to-date reflecting the current status of your project (e.g. any changes that you have made during the project such as changes to your class diagram). Previous versions should still be visible through your commit history.
>  * Each team member should also submit the Individual Contributions Form on Canvas for this final phase. In this form, you need to fill in the names of all team members, the percentage of work contributed by each member for the final phase, and a description of their contributions. Remember that each team member should submit the form individually.
